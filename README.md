# machine_learning_project
This is first machine learning project

creating conda environment
...
conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
...
...
conda activate venv
...
...
pip install -r requirements.txt
...
...
create the app.py file and write the flask code in that to import Flask
...
To add many files together in a git at the single time
use the command   git add .
...
To add single  file  in a git at the single time
use the command   git add <file_name>
...
To add any file or folder in a git we can simply write the name of file in .gitignore
...
To check the status
use the command    git status
...
To check all the version maintained by git
Use the command   git log
...
To create the new version or to commit all changes 
Use the command  git commit -m"message"  ### write the any valid message
...
To check the branch
Use the command    git branch
...
To send version/changes to github
Use the command   git push origin main
...
To check remote url
Use the command    git remote -v
...
To discard the changes in working directory
Use the command    git restore <file_name>
...
Used directory to unstage the file
git restore --staged<file_name>
...
...
For push the files/folder we have to generate the personal access token from github repository and push/save the changes to github.
...

we donot need to delete any version, we can keep all versions and look up it at any time only by chnging the version name/code
...
...
Perform the deployment
To set up CI/CD pipeline in heroku we need 3 informations:
1. Heroku_Email- nikitathakur9938@gmail.com
2. Heroku_API_KEY- 7f7140a0-85e8-4efb-966a-db0ed8da977e   ###found ACCOUNT SETTINGS---API KEY--COPY AND PASTE IT
3. Heroku_APP_NAME-  ml-regression   ###Found NEW APP---CLICK ON IT ---NAME THE APP  #maximum 5 app can be there.
...
Create the Dockerfile
...
BUILD THE DOCKER IMAGE 
...
docker build -t <image_name>:<tagname> .
...
Note- Name of the docker image must be in lowercase letter
...
To list the docker image
...
Use the command    docker images
>>>
Run docker images
...
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e PORT=5000 <Image_code>
...
To check running container in docker
...
docker ps
...
To stop docker container
...
docker stop <container_id>
...
The entire work will run on ubantu system which is allocated from github
Whatever changes we done in our code will be first push to github and other function will be done automatically from github.

We build,run,push the docker container to heroku and we download the image and run and in this way, deployment is done to heroku
...
To deploy the project on Heroku we need 3 informations of Heroku givn above....
...
###After doing all the changes...use
...
git add .
git status
git commit -m"<messages>
git push origin main
....
Then go to github ,it has been updated ....Now, go to SETTINGS---SECRETS---SECRETS ACTIONS---SET UP NEW REPOSITORY SECRETS---HEROKU_EMAIL,HEROKU_API_KEY,HEROKU_APP_NAME..one by one secrets has been done
Now come back to Actions---click on the line commited---re run flow---run all flow ---
...In this way the CI/CD Pipeline has been done...
....
We can check the Heroku and that APP_Name deployment has been done
...
....
fork on github is used to clone the project repossitory in our local system from github in any new system
...
gunicorn is a library used to open/run the flask operation....which is mainly used for linux system not windows system, The task of gunicorn is to accept the request, run it and expose it to others,
...
 Create the folder "Housing" and the new file "setup.py" outside of the housing folder.
 ...
 all the coding related to project will be done inside the housing folder...

 ...
 use the command"python setup.py install" to simply install all the libraries written in requirements.txt 
 without using pip install

 ...

 we are going to do "housing prediction", so create the housing folder and all the files will be under the housing folder.   ###Housing is jst a package

...
we use all the libraries that will be installed after writing it in the requirements.txt and use the command"pip install -r requirements.txt"
...
we use the -e . in the requirements.txt so that housing_predictor packageges and of specific version will be also installed as thye name as housing_predictor.egg.info...so, mainly -e . is going to search all the packagesges and return it in the form of list by installing it...and then type "pip install -r requirements.txt"...setup.py must be installed before using -e .
...
in setup.py we donot use -e . so,we remove it because we used the packageges name there.
Next step to create the branch, by default there is a main branch but we can create integration branch also...
...
Whenever there is git request,then information can be found in the url but if there is the push request then information encrypted in the header it can not be seen.

print("Hello")
